## Highlights

- **Channel Rack** — step sequencer with 4 pattern banks, per-channel volume /
  pan / mute / solo, per-step velocity, resizable step counts (4–128), channel
  reordering and sound-file lanes (drop a sample from the browser to create a
  Sampler channel).
- **Piano Roll** — draw / move / resize / delete notes, velocity lane, grid
  snap (1/32–1) with quantize, horizontal *and* vertical zoom, full 128-note
  range, pitch naming.
- **Playlist** — unlimited virtualized tracks, paint-brush tooling, marquee /
  range selection, duplicate / slice / region tools, drag-and-drop from the
  sample browser.
- **Mixer** — per-track strips (gain / pan / mute / solo), 32-bus DAG routing
  with cycle rescue, parallel sends, per-bus FX with sidechain compressor,
  per-track insert chains (built-in EQ + LV2 hosting).
- **Audio foundation** — PipeWire backend, brickwall master limiter (−1 dBFS,
  live == export), RMS + true-peak metering with sticky clip indicators,
  configurable buffer/sample-rate page with a 440 Hz test tone.
- **Project persistence** — `.misuc` documents are real ZIP containers
  (`misuc.meta` + `misuc.song`), atomic writes, rotated autosave with
  round-trip verification, session recovery, clipboard-safe undo/redo
  (50-step snapshot stack).

## Download

Prebuilt installers are attached to tagged GitHub Releases
([latest](https://github.com/SPOOKEYfr/Misuc/releases)):

| Platform | File | How to install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux (.deb) | `misuc_0.3.0-1_amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./misuc_0.3.0-1_amd64.deb` |
| Windows (.exe) | `misuc-0.3.0-1-win64.exe` | Double-click the installer (installs into `C:\Program Files\Misuc`) |

The Windows audio backend (WASAPI) has not been validated on real hardware
yet — on Linux, Misuc talks to a running PipeWire daemon.

## Building

Prerequisites (Debian / Ubuntu / Mint):

```bash
sudo apt install -y cmake ninja-build g++ \
    qt6-base-dev \
    libpipewire-0.3-dev libasound2-dev libsndfile1-dev \
    pkg-config
```

Configure and build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
./build/bin/misuc_app
```

Options: `MISUC_BUILD_TESTS` and `MISUC_BUILD_UI` (both `ON` by default — see
[`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md)).

### Tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
# or directly:
./build/bin/misuc_tests
```

The engine and editor model are covered by a large unit-test suite
(50k+ assertions and counting). Tests that talk to a live PipeWire daemon
only report counts and never hard-fail a release build.

### Runtime requirements

- A running PipeWire daemon (standard on modern Linux desktops).
- Wayland or X11 session for the UI.

## Repository layout

```
engine/   PipeWire audio engine, DSP (EQ, compressor, pitch), .misuc container
ui/       Qt 6 desktop app (pages, docks, dialogs, theme)
tests/    unit tests (engine + editor model)
tools/    and qa/   maintenance & QA scripts
docs/     architecture notes, status matrix, roadmap, screenshots
```
